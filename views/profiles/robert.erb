		<p>Currently living in <strong>Raleigh, NC</strong>â€”I was born in western New York, in a small town called <a style="color:orange"; href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bemus+Point,+NY+14712/@42.1639568,-79.3979883,2342m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x882d53309969a271:0x788cfb308ce855e6!8m2!3d42.1617242!4d-79.3917144">Bemus Point</a>.  There I grew up with my 2 older brothers and 1 little sister.  My father is a veterinarian and my mother is the manager of both of the practices he owns.  Our home was located in the country, we lived in a two story house with a large yard, a barn and woods with trails.  Growing up we always had multiple dogs, at least 1 cat and for a while cows and horses.  My family are truely wonderful people, who mean the world to me.</p>
    <p>I have achievements in my past that make me proud: Team captain, most athletic award, coach,  1:54 - 800m, certified pharmacy tech, certified mathematics teacher grades 7-12, CSRA most calls completed award, etc.  However, the greatest achievement I have to date is my marriage to Heidi.  That is where my goals for the future come in.  My goal is to be the best husband to her and father to our conceived but not yet born son.  Nerve wracking, uncomfortable, and yes scary as it might be to put myself out there.  I'm going to do it and I'm going to succeed, because I know: I can, I want to and I have to.</p>
    <p>I attended undergrad at <i>SUNY Fredonia</i> where I majored in Mathematics Education for grades 7-12.  After graduation I briefly moved to Raleigh, NC before returning to <i>SUNY Fredonia</i> for my masters degree in Mathematics Education 7-12.  The master's degree was awarded in December of 2016.</p>
    <p>Some of my talents involve:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Running</li>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <li>Video Games</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Growing up in the country I certainly played my part in country boy activities such as mud football, back yard baseball, horseback riding, cross country skiing, pond swimming, pond ice skating, wood collecting and much more.  However, even as young as 4 or 5 I had a nack for video games and probably spent more time playing them then any child probably should.  To this day I love playing video games and even continue to play WOW.  This being said I cannot deny running as another hobby I can never seem to get away from.  No matter how many times I get away from running and racing, I always return.</p>
