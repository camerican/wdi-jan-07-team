		<i>“It’s as real as it can get. That has made me a better person. It’s made me a better man. It’s made me understand myself, my weaknesses, my strengths, the shit I need to work on. Jiu-jitsu has been one of the most valuable tools I’ve ever had in my life.”</i><br />

    <p><strong>North Bergen,NJ</strong>- I have lived in the NJ metro area my entire life. I am twenty seven years old and recently decided to attempt to make a switch into the tech field. Prior to this I spent time working for <i>Milwaukee</i> power tools doing marketing and sales. I went to college at <i>Rutgers</i> and majored in sociology and literature. I also spent some time in the <i>United States Marine Corps</i>. In my spare time I enjoy cooking which is a must because I have been a vegetarian for eight years, Brazilian Jiujitsu, video games, and comics(I mainly read <i>Marvel</i>).Outside of that Im a pretty normal guy thats trying to listen to good music and enjoy life. Feel free to reach out to me on slack on in person if you have any thing else you might want to know about me.</p>
