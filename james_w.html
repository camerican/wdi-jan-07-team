    <p>My name is James Wang, I was born in Shanghai, China and grown up there for 27 years. I became a deaf due to high fever when I was 3 years old. I was enrolled by National Technical Institution for the Deaf for AAS degree in Applied Computer Technology and graduated in 1998 and enrolled by Rochester Institution of Technology in 1998 for Bachelor degree in Information Technology. I graduated in 2002 and IBM hired me for software engineer position. I have been worked with IBM for 6 years and I was laid off from IBM in 2009. I love to travel some conuntries and Chinese painting. 
    </p>

    <p> My primary job is to developed and supported newly developed and existing software applications for Lotus Notes database and IBM VM/MVS.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>  Designed, developed and implemented IBM Change Notification Database that enables administrator to notify selected distribution lists and/or individuals. Recipients of IBM Change complete and respond to assessment of whether their product is impacted or not impacted by change. Database stores feedback of those products as well as ICN notification documents and assessments.
      </li>
      <li>Designed, developed and implemented IBM Health Checker Requirements Database that has a large customer base and is tied into all z/OS components and requires a good system for managing and reporting upon the requirements from customers as well as internal ones. It helps customers increase availability of systems and applications by greater operational awareness and improved system recoverability.  It also can decrease total cost of ownership by reduced operations complexity and outages due to operational errors.  
      </li>
      <li>Designed, developed and implemented IBM Product and Service Requests Database that enables z/OS Build and Installation group to maintain systems for Integration Test, System Test, PET, Benchmark Center, and other testing organizations. This increases productivity for C90A and all testing groups that C90A supports.   Database makes it easier to track the usage of different software that users need and allows test floor to manage large amounts of user requested data.
      </li>
      <li>Designed, developed and implemented IBM Hardware and Software Maintenance Requests Database that allows test floor to control automating computing development and test group requests for machine time.  It also makes it easy to track usage information on kinds of hardware and software that users depend, and allows test floor to find and keep all records in large amounts of request data which contain specified information. 
      </li>
    </ul>
